### [DM Resource Chest](dmresourcechest.com)
#### This site is a web application that I designed for the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game, which is a big hobby of mine. Here's a few notable features:

 - Built using the Angular framework for the front end and the Express framework for the back end
 - Near perfect Google Lighthouse audit scores
 - Efficient caching policy ensures a quick and responsive user experience
 - Custom site-wide search functionality allows for specific information to be easily found
 - Responsive grid layout works well on any device
 - Can be downloaded as a native application for offline functionality
 - Completely keyboard accessible to ensure accessibility for all types of users
